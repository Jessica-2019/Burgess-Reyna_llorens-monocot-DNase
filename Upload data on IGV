Instructions for uploading DNAse I seq data into a genome browser

The follwing instructions describe how to load DHS (Dnase I Hypersensitive Sites) and/or
DGF (Digital Genomic Footprints) onto a genome browser like IGV. 

Prerequisites:
Download the newest version IGV (https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download)

Download the following genome versions and annotations. 
Z. mays: Zmays_284_6a
B. distachyon: Bdistachyon_283_assembly_v2.0
S. bicolor: Sbicolor_255_v2.0
S. italica: S.italica_164_v2.fa


Instructions on how to launch IGV come in the "readme.txt" file within the folder. 

Download the bed files for your organism/experiment of choice provided in here:
DHS.zip : DHS for all species and cell types
DGF.zip : DGF for all species and cell types 

Note: If you are working with different genome versions you can convert the bed files to the corresponding assembly using
the assembly converter from ENSEMBL (https://plants.ensembl.org/tools.html)

Load the corresponding .gff (annotation) .fa (genome) and .bed (dhs/dgf) onto IGV.
