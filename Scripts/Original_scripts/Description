# 1. Mapping reads and DHS calling.              #
##################################################

#First need to create a new bowtie alignment file e.g.
#bowtie2-build [GENOME] [prefix]

## Final_DNase_analysis.sh [Rep_1_reads_1] [Rep_1_reads_2] [Rep_2_reads_1] [Rep_2_reads_2] [Rep_3_reads_1] [Rep_3_reads_2] [BOWTIE] [GENOME] [NAME]
# [Rep_1_reads_1] Reads from biological rep 1 mate pair 1
# [Rep_1_reads_2] Reads from biological rep 1 mate pair 2 etc.
# [BOWTIE] A bowtie2 alignment file for the species of interest
# [GENOME] A fasta file of the genome of the species of interest
# [NAME] prefix that is given to all files e.g. Si_WL
## The following are run automatically from Final_DNase_analysis.sh
# Final IDR analysis
# Final QC Analysis

##################################################
# 2. Script to check saturation. 
##################################################
## Final_saturation_analysis_2.sh [GENOME] [NAME]
#This must be run after Final_DNase_analysis.sh in the same directory
# [GENOME] A fasta file of the genome of the species of interest
# [NAME] corresponds to the ID used in Final_DNase_analysis e.g. Si_WL

# 3. DHS analysis scripts.
##################################################
# The following can be used to generate putative network files, linking transcription factors to genes.
## Motif_Mapping.sh [GENOME] [BED_FILE] [NAME] [ANNOTATION FILE] [EXPRESSION FILE] [TAG] [GFF3 FILE] [CHR FILE]
# [GENOME] A fasta file of the genome of the species of interest
# [BED_FILE] BED file containing all regions of interest in the genome (e.g. DGF sites)
# [NAME] A Prefix to use for output files e.g. Sb for Sorghum Bicolor
# [ANNOTATION FILE] Motif Annotation FILE
# [EXPRESSION FILE] File with expression data
# [TAG] Cell type of interest e.g. bundle sheath =6, whole leaf =5
# [GFF3 FILE] Annotation file of locations of genes in genome. Comes with genome files when downloaded from phytozome. 
# [CHR FILE] Description of chromosomes and sizes, created by UCSC faSize --detailed
## Dependencies
# annotation_2.2.r
# BED_annotation_mapping.r
# merging_scripts.r
## Note
# The set of motifs for mapping is specified in the file, this must be changed if you want to use a different set.

## Rscript to test the distribution of a given feature in the genome.
## Rscript DHS_distribution_mapping.r [ChrFile] [GFF3 file] [Species] [MACSFILE] [SUMMIT]
# [ChrFile]   = Description of chromosomes and sizes, created by UCSC faSize --detailed
# [GFF3 file] = Annotation file of locations of genes in genome. Comes with genome files when downloaded from phytozome. 
# [Species]   = Species Name
# [MACSFILE]  = MACS peaks file (xls file converted to csv)
# [SUMMIT]    = MACS peaks summit locations
